	your devices to develop and test applications. This includes using copies of the software on your 
	own internal servers that remain fully dedicated to your own use. You may not, however, separate

	devices (except as otherwise stated in this agreement), or for any purpose other than developing 
	and testing your applications. 
	b.	Demo Use. The uses permitted above includes use of the software in demonstrating your 
	applications.

your Krueger Systems account. 
5.	TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY.  If you have a Iril Subscription, you may transfer this 
software and the applicable license agreements directly to another party. Before the transfer, that party 
must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software. The transfer must 
include the software and coupon code. You must uninstall all copies of the software after transferring it 
from your device(s). You may not retain any copies of the coupon code to be transferred, and may only

transfer the software or this agreement to another party.
6.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Krueger Systems provides support for the software as described at https://kruegersystems.com/support. 
7.	LIMITED WARRANTY. If you follow the instructions, the software will perform substantially as 
described in the Krueger Systems materials that you receive in or with the software.
References to "limited warranty" are references to the express warranty provided by Krueger Systems. This 
warranty is given in addition to other rights and remedies you may have under law, including your 
rights and remedies in accordance with the statutory guarantees under local Consumer Law.
8.	TERM OF WARRANTY; WARRANTY RECIPIENT; LENGTH OF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES. 
THE LIMITED WARRANTY COVERS THE SOFTWARE FOR ONE YEAR AFTER ACQUIRED BY 
THE FIRST USER. IF YOU RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTS, UPDATES, OR REPLACEMENT 
SOFTWARE DURING THAT YEAR, THEY WILL BE COVERED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 
WARRANTY OR 30 DAYS, WHICHEVER IS LONGER. If the first user transfers the software, the 
remainder of the warranty will apply to the recipient.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR 
CONDITIONS LAST ONLY DURING THE TERM OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY. Some states do 
not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so these limitations may not apply to you. 
They also might not apply to you because some countries may not allow limitations on how long an 
implied warranty, guarantee or condition lasts.
9.	EXCLUSIONS FROM WARRANTY. This warranty does not cover problems caused by your acts (or 
failures to act), the acts of others, or events beyond Krueger Systems's reasonable control.

SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE. IF KRUEGER SYSTEMS CANNOT REPAIR OR REPLACE IT,

REPLACEMENT SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE. IF KRUEGER SYSTEMS CANNOT REPAIR OR REPLACE 
THEM, IT WILL REFUND THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THEM, IF ANY. YOU MUST 
UNINSTALL THE SOFTWARE AND RETURN ANY MEDIA AND OTHER ASSOCIATED 
MATERIALS TO KRUEGER SYSTEMS WITH PROOF OF PURCHASE TO OBTAIN A REFUND. THESE 
ARE YOUR ONLY REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY.

UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE.

guarantees or conditions, despite this exclusion, your remedies are described in the Remedy for Breach

accompanying the software. 
2.	PACKAGE MANAGERS. The software may include package managers, like NuGet, that give you the

doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in 
certain ways. You may not:
	*	work around any technical limitations in the software;

5.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement (including the warranty above), and the terms for 
supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services, are the entire agreement for the 
software and support services.
6.	APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to 
interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply 
to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.
7.	CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. 
You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. 
Separate and apart from your relationship with Krueger Systems, you may also have rights with respect to the 
party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the 
laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one 
of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
	a.	Australia. References to "Limited Warranty" are references to the express warranty provided by 
	Krueger Systems or the manufacturer or installer. This warranty is in addition to other rights and remedies 
	you may have under law, including your rights and remedies in accordance with the statutory 
	guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law.
	In this Section, "goods" refers to the software for which Krueger Systems or the manufacturer or installer 
	provides the express warranty. Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under 
	the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and 
	compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have 
	the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not 
	amount to a major failure
	b.	Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off 
	the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you 
	re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), 
	or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off 
	updates for your specific device or software.
	c.	Germany and Austria.
	i.	Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any 
	Krueger Systems materials that accompany the software. However, Krueger Systems gives no contractual 
	guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
	ii.	Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the 
	Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Krueger Systems is 
	liable according to the statutory law.
	Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Krueger Systems will only be liable for slight negligence if Krueger Systems is in 
	breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due 
	performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this 
	agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal 
	obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Krueger Systems will not be liable for slight negligence.
8.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM KRUEGER SYSTEMS 
AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU 
PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE OR $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL 
DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on 
third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of 
warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by 
applicable law.

It also applies even if Krueger Systems knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The 
above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the 
exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
